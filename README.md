## Reproduction steps

First, you will have to start this project on your local

Next, open multiple tabulations with different paths like `/aa` or `/bb` or `/cc` (you can keep going)

Lastly, you will have to refresh all of your tabulations at once

You might see that multiple or every tabs have the same title and in their body, the same path indicated (only one with the correct path, the rest, the path of another one)
